abstract: 'In this paper, we propose an extension of the cabling methods to bijective non-degenerate solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation, with applications to indecomposable and simple solutions. We address two main challenges in extending this technique to the non-involutive case. First, we establish that the indecomposability of a solution can be assessed through its injectivization or the associated biquandle. Second, we show that the canonical embedding into the structure monoid resolves issues related to the pullback of subsolutions. Our results not only extend the theorems of Lebed, Ramirez and Vendramin to non-involutive solutions but also provide numerical criteria for indecomposability.'
