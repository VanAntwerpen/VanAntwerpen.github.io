abstract: 'A complete classification of all finite bijective set-theoretic solutions (S,s) to the Pentagon Equation is obtained. First, it is shown that every such a solution determines a semigroup structure on the set S that is the direct product E\times G of a semigroup of left zeros E and a group G. Next, we prove that this leads to a decomposition of the set S as a Cartesian product X\times A\times G, for some sets X,A and to a discovery of a hidden group structure on A. Then an unexpected structure of a matched product of groups A,G is found such that the solution (S,s) can be explicitly described as a lift of a solution determined on the set A\times G by this matched product of groups. Conversely, every matched product of groups leads to a family of solutions arising in this way. Moreover, a simple criterion for the isomorphism of two solutions is obtained. The results provide a far reaching extension of the results of Colazzo, Jespers and Kubat, dealing with the special case of the so called involutive solutions. Connections to the solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation and to the theory of skew braces are derived.'
